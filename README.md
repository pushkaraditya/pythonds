# Python Data Structures (pythonds)
Attempts to solve the problems provided in online book "Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures using PythonÂ¶" (https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/pythonds/index.html)

There seems to be some very beautiful examples of the problem, I aim to solve it as elegantly as I can

Notes
* Although I have tried to organize it however as of now it is not working when you execute the files (or code) in root directory as following

```linux
> python chapter4\ex.4.5.1.py
```

It works if you go to specified directory and execute the code i.e.
```linux
> cd chapter4
> python ex.4.5.1.py
```
